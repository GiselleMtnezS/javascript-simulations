hello player, give me your name. (saves name here)
press w to walk or e to exit(
    if exit: say ByeMessage and close everything.
    if walking: run random algorithm. 
        if random algorith is not 1/4 of probaility: keep walking until e or random algorith= 1/4
        
        if random algorith is 1/4 of probability: an enemy creature appears AND run another random algorith to determine which creature
            after determined creature, ask player what to do: "run" or "attack" 
                if run: 50% of running chance
                if attack: random algorithm between min and max to determine strength of attack  
                in either case, after player chooses creature will have chance of attack, random algorith determines strength of attack again
            if creature kills player. {Everything resets and payer is weaker. } <===== bs
            if player kills creature he becomes stronger. 
            either way player can choose to keep walking or not. 
if player writes "print" at any moment they have to see their scores
